# zombieShooter (Apocalypse Alpha Build)
Playing as the young fighter Sky, you must defeat waves up waves of zombies in order to survive the zombie apocalypse.  The more zombies you kill, the more score you'll get in order to use to purchase upgrades.  However, the more waves you clear, the more difficult the waves become.

This game is a prototype of a game idea I had which would include a storyline, however this Alpha Build does not contain any story elements.
